## Coding Standards

Exoskeleton adheres to the WordPress VIP coding standards. All pull requests are
automatically tested with PHP Codesniffer. To make testing easy, we've provided
phpcs and phpcbf make targets. The first will test the repo against the
WordPress-VIP PHP Codesniifer rules and the second will automatically fix many
coding standards issues. You can also add phpcbf integrations to many text
editors to automatically fix issues as you write.
